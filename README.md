## Abstract: 
Emerging infectious diseases threaten agriculture, the economy, and global biodiversity. More specifically, the fungal pathogen, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), is among the leading causes of amphibian mass mortality worldwide. To treat Bd infection, 5-minute itraconazole bathes are administered for seven to ten consecutive days, which can be logistically challenging and time-consuming if treating wild populations. Recently, a second compound, 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMP), showed large anti-fungal properties in vitro, which would only require a single topical application to treat Bd infection. Here, we examined how Bd and these two anti-fungals (i.e., itraconazole and BMP) affect amphibian behavior and performance in terms of jumping ability, appetite, and habitat use. These metrics were chosen because of their potential effects on predator evasion, reproductive success, and pathogen transmission. We found that uninfected individuals, the negative control, gained the most weight over time, followed by individuals that were able to clear infection (i.e., Bd + itraconazole). Bd-infected individuals, the positive control, gained the least amount of weight over time. We also found that Bd load negatively correlated with amphibian weight, where more heavily infected individuals weighed less. We also found that Bd infection intensity and the two anti-fungal treatments did not affect jumping performance, suggesting that predator evasion and reproductive success are not hindered by Bd infection and contact rates may remain constant over the course of infection. We found subtle changes in habitat use by treatment, where all treatments increased their use of the shelter through time, and Bd-infected treatments (i.e., Bd only, Bd+BMP) increased their time on walls and in open areas. Collectively, our results suggest that there are little to no short-term side effects of either anti-fungal application to amphibian host behavior or performance, and we caution that long-term effects should be considered in the future.
